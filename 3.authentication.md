To be able to connect to the API you need to get an access token. After that you create a request header with the name `Authorization` and value `Bearer [access token]`.

Get an access token with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/):  
1. Select authorization type `Oauth2`.  
2. Select add authorization data to `Request headers`.  
3. Click *Get New Access Token*.  
4. Set *Grant Type* `Authorization Code`.  
5. Set *Callback URL* `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`.  
6. Set *Auth URL* `https://api.northbricks.io/oauth/authorize`.  
7. Set *Access Token URL* `https://api.northbricks.io/oauth/token`.  
8. Set *Client ID* to your Client ID.  
9. Set *Client Secret* to your Client Secret.  
10. Set *scope* to `read` (scopes are not fully implemented yet).  
11. Set *Client Authentication* `Send as Basic Auth header`.  
12. Click *Request token* and login with a user that you created with [https://api.northbricks.io/signup](https://api.northbricks.io/signup).  
13. You can now start using the api. Try to make a `GET` request to [https://api.northbricks.io/api/v1/me/banks](https://api.northbricks.io/api/v1/me/banks) with the aquired token in a request header. It should return an empty array of banks.
